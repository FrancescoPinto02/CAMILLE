  utter_define_codesmell:
  - text: A code smell refers to any characteristic in the source code of a program that indicates there might be a deeper problem. It's often a sign that the code could be structured or written in a better way. Just like a foul odor indicates there might be something wrong in the physical world, a code smell indicates there might be something wrong with the code. Codesmells can lead to various issues such as decreased code maintainability, increased complexity, and higher chances of introducing bugs. Ignoring codesmells can result in technical debts and make future development more difficult and costly.
  utter_technical_debt:
  - text: Technical debt is a concept in software development that refers to the extra work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution. Accumulating technical debt can result in increased development time, reduced code quality, and higher maintenance costs.
